# Building an Extension

Extensions are typically built around a vendor (ex. Slack) and may include a number of stage types, settings, and more that work in together to provide an integration and/or toolset.

## Extension Spec and Requirements

* Extension Packages must start with `mc-ext-`

There is partial spec of sorts, and notes on [GitHub Issue #86 "New Extension Format Spec"](https://github.com/space-race/mc-core/issues/86)

## Extension Validator Helper

There is a script, [mc-extension-validator](https://github.com/space-race/mc-extension-validator), to help validate your extension.
